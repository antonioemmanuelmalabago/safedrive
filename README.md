## 📋 Overview

The global issue of drunk driving accidents, coupled with inadequate proactive measures, highlights significant risks to public safety. The proposed solution, Safedrive, utilizes an IoT-based system incorporates hardware components such as Arduino Uno R3, ESP32-Cam, MICS-5524 Gas Sensor, SIM900A GSM, and NEO-6M GPS. Its main goal is to detect alcohol in car vehicles, provide real-time alerts, and precisely identify the location of intoxicated drivers. This projects aims to encourage responsible drinking, foster safe driving practices, and enhance overall road safety.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create an efficient anti-drunk driving system capable of classifying drunk drivers
- Identify a drunk driver by detecting high alcohol PPM and occurence of bloodshot eyes
- Incorporate a cloud database for remote and wireless transmission of data
- Integrate an image classification for detecting bloodshot eyes
